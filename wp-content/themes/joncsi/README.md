A developer-friendly starter theme used for creating commercial child themes for the Genesis Framework.

It uses Composer to pull in the [Core](https://github.com/seothemes/core) component library which provides the PHP logic for the theme's configuration, and it uses [Gulp WP Toolkit](https://github.com/craigsimps/gulp-wp-toolkit) to automate mundane build tasks like compiling SCSS and minifying images.

Check out the [live demo](https://demo.seothemes.com/genesis-starter)

## Features

The Jaywon Nein CSI aims to modernize, organize and enhance some aspects of Genesis child theme development. Take a look at what is waiting for you:

- [Bourbon](https://github.com/seothemes/joncsi/tree/master/resources/scss) as a lightweight Sass toolkit
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for automating development build tasks
- [Browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) for synchronized browser testing
- [Config-based](https://www.alainschlesser.com/config-files-for-reusable-code/), OOP modular architecture
- [CLI setup script](#setup) to automatically update information
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) for managing Node dependencies
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) for managing PHP dependencies
- [PSR-4](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/) class autoloading
- [Namespaced](http://php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.basics.php) to avoid naming conflicts

## Installation

### One line command:

Install the latest development version of the Jaywon Nein CSI using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
composer create-project seothemes/joncsi your-theme-name dev-master && cd "$(\ls -1dt ./*/ | head -n 1)" && sh setup.sh
```

### Individual commands:

Install the latest development version of the Jaywon Nein CSI using Composer from your WordPress themes directory (replace `your-theme-name` below with the name of your theme):

```shell
composer create-project seothemes/joncsi your-theme-name dev-master
```

Navigate into the theme's root directory:

```shell
cd your-theme-name
```

Run the setup script to rename the theme, build the theme assets and kick-off BrowserSync:

```shell
sh setup.sh
```

## Setup

The Jaywon Nein CSI includes a powerful setup script which automates the process of updating theme details:

<a href="https://github.com/seothemes/joncsi/blob/master/setup.sh" target="_blank"><img src="https://briantics.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/joncsi-setup-script.png" alt="Jaywon Nein CSI setup script" width="500"></a>

It replaces the following details with your own:

- Theme name
- Theme textdomain
- Theme author
- Theme author URL
- Theme development URL
- Theme namespace
- Theme version

## Usage

The Jaywon Nein CSI is intended to be used with [Briantics, Inc. Core](https://packagist.org/packages/seothemes/core). All changes to the child theme should be made via the theme configuration file. This can be used to change almost every aspect of the theme, including theme features, navigation menus, image sizes, widget areas and more. An example config file is included with this theme.

Components are only loaded when a config key is provided. They can be added or removed depending on the requirements of your project. For example, to remove the PluginActivation component, simply remove it's config key from the return statement in `config/defaults.php`.

The `app` directory is provided to house project-specific PHP files if additional functionality is required. It comes pre-configured with PSR-4 autoloading. Custom components can be created in the same way other Core components are, by first creating a class which extends the `Component` class and then adding it's configuration to the theme's config file. An [Example Component](https://github.com/seothemes/joncsi/blob/master/app/Example.php) is included with the theme to get you started.

Project details such as theme name, author, version number etc should only ever be changed from the `package.json` file. The Gulp build task reads this file and automatically places the relevant information to the correct locations throughout the theme. 

Static assets are organized in the `resources` directory. This folder contains theme scripts, styles, images, fonts, views and language translation files.

## Development

Please refer to the [Gulp WP Toolkit Instructions](https://github.com/craigsimps/gulp-wp-toolkit#tasks) for a complete list of available build tasks.

In addition to Gulp WP Toolkit's tasks, there is also a `zip` task which can be used to generate an archive of your theme, including the required composer package files and none of the unnecessary files. The list of included files can be modified from the `toolkit.extendConfig.src.zip` config in the Gulpfile.
